# Clavier Gerber Files
Within this folder is the Clavier keyboard Gerber files. These files are provided "as-is", and aren't recommended to be used. I will not update them if they become outdated, nor do I claim they work.

I **DO NOT** even recommend using them, since it's a lot of effort to get the keyboard working, as well as arguably dangerous, since you require a dremel, which will make **FIBREGLASS DUST**. Inhaling this is actually very dangerous, which is why I do not recommend making this keyboard.

Again, this repo is for archival and inspirational purposes.
