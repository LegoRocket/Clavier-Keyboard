# Firmware
Here's the QMK firmware used for the Clavier. It's been a while since I've updated it, so due to my amazing naming schemes, I honestly don't know what one is the most recent.

Firmware generated from the [kbfirmware](https://kbfirmware.com/) website. At the time, QMK was too complicated to develop on my own, so it was generated through this site.
